So while I was in CS 104 (Data Structures), I had to attend office hours at SAL a BOAT load of times to get help.
On days that assignments were due, there would literally be 30 students on the board waiting to get help.
Many times, students get skipped or have their name erased due to the uncontrollable environment SAL becomes when 
it is packed. Another occuring problem, was that I would make the long trek to SAL, hoping to get help from someone
only to find out that office hours had been canceled by the CP/TA. Likewise, I would plan to go to SAL get help really
fast, and make it to class on time. Many times, the board would be filled with student names and my plans would not 
go as planned.

Solution! (Or possible solution): Have a webapp that lets students sign up for office hours and enter their name into
a queue. This would prevent having people skipped and the above mentioned problems CS students have to deal with.

Problem: Student's name gets erased, therefore cannot get help from TA/CP
Solution: Student is entered into a queue where only the TA/CP can delete the student's name only after the student got
help or did not report to the TA/CP at SAL within a certain time limit (should be reasonable).

Problem: Student keeps getting skipped, other students put their name before the student that has been waiting for a long time
Solution: Students are entered into a generic queue (to the back).

Problem: Student does not know how many students might be at SAL asking for help and has to run to class, but goes to SAL anyways
because he or she really needs help.
Solution: The student can login and check how many students are already in line, waiting to be helped.

Problem: Student cannot put their name on the list until he or she is physically present at SAL.
Solution: The student can sign in from wherever and put his or her name into the queue.
