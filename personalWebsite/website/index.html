		  <h1>David Valdez</h1>
			  <p> Hello! My name is David Valdez. I am a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California.
			  I've always been interested in technology from a young age, however, I was not aware of the many branches within technology. I became
			  the black sheep of my family once I made the move to engineering compeletely. I've always wanted to excel in math and science and when I 
			  realized Economics and Business (no love lost, right?) did not offer that, I looked into something else.
			  </br>
			  After taking an introduction course to C++ at LAVC, I realized this was my true calling. Entering USC, I skipped the orientation I was 
			  registered for and attended the engineering orientation; I haven't looked back since.
			</p>

					<h2>Sports</h2>
					<hr>
					<p> I love sports. Some of my favorites are: soccer, football, basketball, and baseball.
					</p>
					<h3>Favorite teams</h3>
					<!-- <ul style="list-style-type:none"> -->
						<button class="accordion">Ravens</button>
							<div class="panel">
	  							<p>The Ravens' 2016-2017 season was bad, but not the worst. They
	  							were a win a way from getting into the playoffs. I have higher hopes
	  							for them this upcoming season.
	  							</p>
							</div>

						<button class="accordion">Dodgers</button>
							<div class="panel">
	  							<p>*Look at Ravens description* Seriously. The Dodgers are packed
	  							with talent and anything less than World Series is considered a 
	  							bust. Hopefully they bounce back this upcoming season.</p>
							</div>

						<button class="accordion">Lakers</button>
							<div class="panel">
	 							 <p>Next...</p>

							<h2>Design</h2>
							<hr>
						<div class = "section-content">
							<p>I've always been interested in having my own business. Like any other bored kid
							in class, I would doodle in my school notes. I took a Digital Design course in high school
							that mainly dealt with Adobe Photoshop. There, I learned a few cool tricks that
							are achievable by learning a little bit of Photoshop. After downloading it onto
							my own personal computer, I got started with my own designs. I noticed my designs 
							would almost always take the same roll, a fictional phenomena that my friend and I
							came up with in middle school (shoutout to CJ Pinion).
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3>FuegoFuerte</h3>
								Cj and I were taking intermedial Spanish in 8th grade at Sleepy Hill. He asked 
								me what was the correct way to translate "fye power" to spanish. I thought about
								it for a second and then I responded, "fuego fuerte." Those two words have stuck 
								with me since. It is difficult to translate and explain what they mean to me, for now 
								just take it for what it is. Think something like Beast Mode...
